Welcome to structure_comp's documentation!
==========================================

The purpose of the structure_comp package is to provide computational materials' scientist with
easy-to-use tools to:

* remove structural duplicates from structural databases (useful for high-throughput studies)
* compare structures and distributions across feature and structure space (useful for machine learning)

The routines for removal of duplicates are implemented in a cached version and use, if possible,
mulitprocessing.
